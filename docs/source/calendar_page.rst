========================

the Calendar page is one of the main pages of the housemate application, it shows the a calendar with the current day displayed. 
when you click on one of the days the calendar will open up a side bar that displays:
    - the current day in a string format,
    - it then shows a section for the current users tasks, that displays the current users set chores
    - underneath that it will show all of the other users tasks with:
        - their name
        - and what ever tasks they ahve set today and if they have completed that task or not

at the bottom of the selected day sidebar, there is a add button for adding chores, you select a day then press the button to 
add a chore to that specific day, the chore can be named what ever and it will be assigned to the current user of the app. The added
chore will be added to the database and will be saved so if you close that window you can see the chore.

at the top of the calendar, it shows the current month and year, it has two side arrow buttons for changing the month.
        
The design of the calendar is supposed to be simple to use and not to over complecated, making it easier for new users to use
