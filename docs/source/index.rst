Welcome to XML Learning Summary!
===================================

XML Learning Summary (/ˌɛksˌɛmˈɛl/) is a structured language used for storing and transporting data.
It provides a flexible and self-descriptive format that is widely used in web development, data exchange, and configuration files.
XML follows a hierarchical structure with custom-defined tags, making it both human-readable and machine-parsable.
