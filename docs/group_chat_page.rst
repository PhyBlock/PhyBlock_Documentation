Group Chat page: 
========================

The Group Chat page is another main page of the housemates app, it allows for fluent communication between the housemates of a specific 
house, the layout of the page is a simple one consisting of:
    - a side bar that shows the current house and the users of that house
    - a Groupchat Screen that shows the messages in the Groupchat

on the groupchat screen, the messages are displayed and are split between, the current users messages and everyone elses messgaes, each 
message is timestamped and displays who sent it. Each message is seperated by a bar defining the day it was set. making it easier to keep
track of when a message is sent

At the bottom of this page there is a bar for entering messages and sending them, once you send the message it will be added to the 
database with its sent time, and will be displayed on the groupchat screen.

We took inspiration from other messaging sites like discord. as they are good examples of easy to learn design.
